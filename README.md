# Realschule Herrieden Web App
_Please note that this project is still in beta_

This is the open source web application from Realschule Herrieden


## Getting Started
The following steps will guide you, how to set your own copy of the web app up.

### Browser Support
Your browser need to support ECMAScript 6, according to [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_versions.asp), ECMAScript 6 is partially supported in all modern browsers.

### Prerequisites
To host your own copy of the RSHerrieden replacement plan web app you'll just need a webserver supporting php(>=5 should work fine) and that has php curl installed. If you have a remote webserver (e.g. a hoster or your own server) you might will need a program to upload these files via ftp or sftp. I recommend using [winSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) on windows and [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) on Linux/Mac OS.


### Setup
Just copy the files from [the latest release](https://github.com/RSHerrieden/WebApp/releases/latest) onto your webserver in the specific location where you want it (e.g. /webapp/).
You can now open the URL and enjoy viewing your replacements.




## Any problems?
 - Since this is free software, you can try everything to fix it on your own. Just as a hint, you'll might check do all files can be accessed over your browser properly. We would like to hear from you if you were able to fix an issue that could affect multiple users. 
 - If you don't have any idea about how and what, just make sure if all the files are copied correctly to your remote server. If these are, just open [a new issue](https://github.com/RSHerrieden/WebApp/issues/new) (don't forgot to include the URL where your installation can be accessed)
