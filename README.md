# Realschule Herrieden Web App
_Please note that this project still is in beta_

This is the open source web application from Realschule Herrieden


## Getting Started
The following steps will guide you, how to setup your own copy of the web app


### Prerequisites
To host your own copy of the RSHerrieden replacement plan web app you'll just need a webserver supporting php and php curl installed. If you have a remote webserver (e.g. a hoster or your own server) you might will need a program to upload that files via ftp or sftp. I recommend using [winSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) on windows and [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) on Linux/Mac OS.


### Setup
Just copy the files from [the latest release](https://github.com/RSHerrieden/WebApp/releases/latest) on to your webserve in the specific location where you want it (e.g. /webapp/).
You now can open the URL and enjoy viewing your replacements.




## Any problems?
 - Since this is free software, you can try everything to fix it on your own. Just as a hint, you'll might check do all files can be accessed over your browser properly. We would like to hear from you if you were able to fix an issue that could affect multiple users. 
 - If you don't have any idea about how and what, just make sure if all the files are copied correctly to your remote server. If these are, just open [a new issue](https://github.com/RSHerrieden/WebApp/issues/new) (don't forgot to include the URL where your installation can be accessed)
